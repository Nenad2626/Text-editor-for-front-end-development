# Text-editor-for-front-end-development
Greetings :) .This is simple text editor made for front end development.First textarea is for HTML coding,second is for CSS coding and last one is of course for Javascript.HTML and CSS are working without problem, JS also works fine but it has minor glitch who doesn't affect coding that much.For example if you use variable VAR you will not have so many errors like with LET and CONST.Let and const display an error every time you use the same variable name.So in order to prevent that, first you must type some function, in that function you can type let and const and after you're sure your code is gonna work execute function(call it) and no error will be displayed in console log.So let and const must be in nested function if you use them.Give me a feedback if you like it :) .
